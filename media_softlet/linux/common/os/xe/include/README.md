This directory contains a copy of the installed kernel headers
required by the iHD driver to communicate with the kernel.
Whenever driver needs new definitions for new kernel
APIs, these files should be updated.

These files in master should only be updated once the changes have landed
in the drm-xe-next tree (see https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/xe/kernel.git).

You can copy files installed after running this from the kernel
repository, at version the driver require:

$ make headers_install INSTALL_HDR_PATH=/path/to/install

The last update was done at the following kernel commit:

commit b2121f2bd2232cd0556b2182078d159d81497885 (HEAD -> drm-xe-next, origin/drm-xe-next)

drm/xe: Extend uAPI to query HuC micro-controler firmware version

The infrastructure to query GuC firmware version is already in place. It
is extended with a new micro-controller type to query the HuC firmware
version. It can be used from user space to know if HuC is running.
